This project builds a PCL extension (plug-in) for the Presentation stimulus delivery software from Neurobehaviora Systems (www.neurobs.com). The extension manages communication with the RemoteControl 1.1 for BrainVision Recorder program from Brain Products (http://www.brainproducts.com/).

The project has the following dependencies:
- Visual Studio 2015
- Presentation SDK (available from www.neurobs.com)
- Boost 1.64.0 C++ library

The project is expecting the following relative file locations:
this_repository/*
PresentationSDK/*
boost/boost_1_64_0/*

See the Presentation documentation concerning usage of the extension DLL once built.
